## Activation Checklist (After Approval)

When LinkedIn approves the API access (1-2 weeks):

### Phase 1: Enable OAuth Scopes (5 minutes)

**File**: `app/api/auth/linkedin/route.ts`

```typescript
// BEFORE (current):
const SCOPES = [
  'openid',
  'profile',
  'email',
  'w_member_social',
  // Analytics scopes (pending approval - DO NOT UNCOMMENT until approved):
  // 'r_member_postAnalytics',
  // 'rw_organization_admin',
].join(' ');

// AFTER (when approved):
const SCOPES = [
  'openid',
  'profile',
  'email',
  'w_member_social',
  'r_member_postAnalytics',    // ✅ Uncomment
  'rw_organization_admin',     // ✅ Uncomment
].join(' ');
```

**Commit**: `git commit -m "Enable LinkedIn analytics OAuth scopes"`

### Phase 2: Activate UI (5 minutes)

**File**: `components/dashboard/analytics/linkedin-insights.tsx`

Replace entire file with the complete analytics version:
```bash
# Use git to restore the analytics version
git show HEAD~1:components/dashboard/analytics/linkedin-insights.tsx > components/dashboard/analytics/linkedin-insights.tsx
```

Or manually update to show real analytics (code is in git history).

**Commit**: `git commit -m "Activate LinkedIn analytics UI"`

### Phase 3: Deploy Database Schema (2 minutes)

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250124_linkedin_analytics.sql
```

This creates:
- `linkedin_analytics` table
- `linkedin_api_quota` table
- Helper functions

### Phase 4: Enable Cron Job (3 minutes)

**File**: `vercel.json`

Add:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron/refresh-linkedin-analytics",
    "schedule": "0 * * * *"
  }]
}
```

**Environment Variable**:
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard
CRON_SECRET=your-secure-random-string
```

**Commit**: `git commit -m "Enable LinkedIn analytics cron job"`

### Phase 5: Deploy & Notify (2 minutes)

```bash
git push origin main
```

**User Communication**:
Send email/notification to existing users:
> "LinkedIn analytics are now available! Please disconnect and reconnect your LinkedIn account in Settings to enable this feature."

---

## Total Activation Time: ~15 minutes

Once approved, the entire system can go live in under 15 minutes:
1. Uncomment scopes (2 min)
2. Restore UI (3 min)
3. Run migration (2 min)
4. Add cron config (3 min)
5. Deploy (5 min)

**Zero refactoring needed** - Everything is ready to go!

## FAQ

### Q: Can users see the analytics code in the browser?
**A**: No. Backend services and API endpoints are server-side only. Users only see the "Coming Soon" UI.

### Q: Will this break anything?
**A**: No. The infrastructure exists but won't be called. It's like having a feature flag set to "off".

### Q: What if LinkedIn rejects the application?
**A**: All code stays in place. The "Coming Soon" message remains accurate. No cleanup needed.

### Q: Can we test the analytics before approval?
**A**: Not with real LinkedIn data. But the code is fully implemented and will work once scopes are enabled.

### Q: How long until approval?
**A**: Typically 1-2 weeks for Development tier, then another 1-2 weeks for Standard tier if needed.
