# Streamlined Trial Signup Flow - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Implemented & Deployed
**Build Status:** ✅ All tests passing

---

## 🎯 Overview

Implemented a streamlined signup flow that removes friction and increases conversion by sending users directly to Stripe Checkout from the pricing page, eliminating the need for manual signup.

### Before vs. After

| Before (Multi-Step) | After (Streamlined) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1. User visits pricing | 1. User visits pricing |
| 2. User signs up (email verification) | 2. User clicks "Start Free Trial" |
| 3. User logs in | 3. **→ Stripe Checkout** |
| 4. User clicks "Start Trial" | 4. Account auto-created |
| 5. Stripe checkout | 5. User auto-logged in → Dashboard |
| 6. User becomes trial subscriber | |
| **6 steps, multiple drop-offs** | **2 steps, direct flow** |

## 📋 What Changed

### 1. Free Tier Redefined (`lib/subscription/plans.ts`)

**Purpose:** Provide limited access for cancelled subscriptions instead of complete lockout.

```typescript
free: {
  id: 'free',
  name: 'Free',
  description: 'Limited access for cancelled subscriptions',
  price_monthly: 0,
  price_yearly: 0,
  features: {
    posts_per_month: 1,        // Changed from 0
    platforms: 'all',
    analytics: false,
    ai_suggestions: false,
    trial_days: 0,
  },
  limits: {
    posts_per_month: 1,         // 1 post per month
    connected_accounts: 1,       // 1 social account
    ai_suggestions_per_month: 0,
    storage_mb: 50,              // 50MB storage
  },
}
```

**Impact:** Users who cancel subscriptions now downgrade to free tier instead of losing all access.

---

### 2. Stripe Checkout API (`app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`)

**Purpose:** Support both authenticated and non-authenticated users going to checkout.

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Made authentication optional
- ✅ Added `email` parameter for new signups
- ✅ Changed success URL to new callback endpoint: `/api/auth/callback/stripe?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
- ✅ Added metadata: `is_new_signup`, `user_email`
- ✅ Stripe collects email if user not logged in

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "planId": "professional",
  "billingCycle": "monthly",
  "email": "user@example.com"  // Optional, only for non-authenticated
}
```

---

### 3. Stripe Callback Endpoint (`app/api/auth/callback/stripe/route.ts`) **[NEW FILE]**

**Purpose:** Handle post-checkout account creation and auto-login.

**Flow:**
1. Retrieve Stripe session by `session_id`
2. Extract customer email and metadata
3. **If new signup:**
   - Create Supabase user via Admin API
   - Auto-verify email (trusted source)
   - Generate random password (user won't use it)
   - Update Stripe customer metadata with `supabase_user_id`
   - Update subscription metadata
4. **Generate magic link** for auto-login
5. Redirect to magic link (user logged in automatically)

**Error Handling:**
- Missing session_id → Redirect to `/?error=missing_session`
- Missing email → Redirect to `/?error=missing_email`
- Account creation failed → Redirect to `/?error=account_creation_failed`
- Login failed → Redirect to `/?error=login_failed`

---

### 4. Webhook Updates (`app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`)

#### `checkout.session.completed` Enhancement

**Problem:** New signups have `user_id = 'new_signup'` or `'pending'` in metadata.

**Solution:** Multi-source user_id detection
```typescript
if (!user_id || user_id === 'new_signup' || user_id === 'pending') {
  // 1. Try Stripe customer metadata (updated by callback)
  const customer = await stripe.customers.retrieve(session.customer)
  user_id = customer.metadata?.supabase_user_id

  // 2. Fallback: Look up by email in Supabase
  if (!user_id) {
    const users = await supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.listUsers()
    const matchedUser = users.find(u => u.email === user_email)
    user_id = matchedUser?.id
  }
}
```

#### `customer.subscription.deleted` Rewrite

**Before:** Deactivated user account completely
```typescript
// OLD: User loses all access
update({ status: 'canceled', is_active: false })
```

**After:** Downgrade to free tier
```typescript
// NEW: User keeps limited access
update({
  plan_id: 'free',
  status: 'active',
  billing_cycle: null,
  stripe_subscription_id: null,
  is_active: true,  // User stays logged in
  downgraded_at: new Date().toISOString()
})
```

---

### 5. Subscription Gate (`components/subscription/subscription-gate.tsx`)

**Purpose:** Allow free tier users to access the app (limits enforced elsewhere).

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Blocked all users without hasSubscription
if (!subscription?.hasSubscription) {
  return <UpgradeGate />
}

// After: Only block users with no account at all
const hasNoAccount = !subscription  // Not even free tier
if (hasNoAccount) {
  return <UpgradeGate />
}

// Free tier and paid users both get access
return <>{children}</>
```

**Usage Limit Enforcement:**
Limits are checked at **action time** via existing `checkAndIncrementUsage()`:
- Creating a post → Check `posts_per_month` limit
- Using AI → Check `ai_suggestions_per_month` limit
- Connecting account → Check `connected_accounts` limit

---

### 6. Pricing Page (`app/pricing/page-client.tsx`)

**Purpose:** Remove signup modal, send all users directly to Stripe.

**Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Non-authenticated users see signup modal
if (!isAuthenticated) {
  setSignUpPlanId(planId)
  setSignUpOpen(true)
  return
}

// AFTER: All users go directly to Stripe
const handleStartTrial = async (planId: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/stripe/checkout', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ planId, billingCycle })
  })
  const { url } = await response.json()
  window.location.href = url  // Direct to Stripe
}
```

**FAQ Updated:**
```
Question: "Do you offer a free trial?"
Before: "No credit card required."
After: "Credit card required but you won't be charged until after
        the trial ends. Cancel anytime during the trial at no cost."
```

---

## 🚨 Known Edge Cases & Handling

### 1. User Already Exists with Email

**Scenario:** User enters email in Stripe that already has a Supabase account.

**Handling:**
```typescript
// In callback endpoint
const { data: authData, error: authError } = await supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.createUser(...)
if (authError) {
  // Check if user already exists
  const existingUser = await findUserByEmail(email)
  if (existingUser) {
    userId = existingUser.id  // Use existing account
    console.log('✅ User already exists, using existing account')
  }
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Uses existing account, updates subscription

---

### 2. Webhook Fires Before Callback Completes

**Scenario:** `checkout.session.completed` webhook fires before callback endpoint finishes creating user.

**Handling:**
```typescript
// Webhook checks multiple sources for user_id
if (user_id === 'pending') {
  // 1. Try customer metadata
  user_id = customer.metadata.supabase_user_id

  // 2. Try email lookup
  if (!user_id) {
    user_id = await lookupUserByEmail(user_email)
  }
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Webhook waits/retries or finds user_id via email lookup

---

### 3. Stripe Checkout Abandoned

**Scenario:** User starts checkout but closes browser before completing.

**Handling:**
- No account created (only happens post-checkout)
- Stripe session expires after 24 hours
- No database records created

**Result:** ✅ No orphaned data, user can try again

---

### 4. Magic Link Expires

**Scenario:** User doesn't click magic link within expiry time (usually 1 hour).

**Handling:**
- Account still exists in Supabase
- User can request password reset or use "Sign In" button
- Magic link system will generate new link

**Result:** ✅ User can still access account via password reset

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: User Not Auto-Logged In After Checkout

**Symptoms:**
- Redirected to dashboard but sees login form
- URL shows `/api/auth/callback/stripe` but stops there

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check Vercel logs for callback endpoint
2. Look for error messages in webhook logs
3. Check if magic link was generated

**Common Causes:**
- Magic link generation failed
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` not set in Vercel
- Email doesn't match between Stripe and Supabase

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check environment variables in Vercel
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<value>
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.socialcal.app

# Test magic link generation manually
curl -X POST https://www.socialcal.app/api/auth/magic-link \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'
```

---

### Problem: Webhook Says "Cannot process subscription without valid user_id"

**Symptoms:**
- Webhook returns 500 error
- Log shows: `❌ Could not determine user_id for new signup`

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check Stripe customer metadata: `supabase_user_id` should be set
2. Check if account was created in Supabase
3. Check webhook timing (might be too fast)

**Common Causes:**
- Callback endpoint failed to create account
- Callback endpoint didn't update Stripe metadata
- Email mismatch

**Fix:**
```bash
# Manually update Stripe customer metadata
stripe customers update cus_xxx \
  --metadata supabase_user_id=<uuid>

# Resend webhook
stripe events resend evt_xxx
```

---

### Problem: User Gets Stuck on "Checking subscription status..."

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard shows loading spinner forever
- SubscriptionGate never resolves

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check if `user_subscriptions` row exists
3. Check RLS policies on `user_subscriptions` table

**Common Causes:**
- RLS policy blocks user from reading their own subscription
- Subscription row not created
- Supabase Auth session expired

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check if user can read their subscription
SELECT * FROM user_subscriptions WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- If empty, check if row exists at all
SELECT * FROM user_subscriptions WHERE user_id = '<uuid>';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'user_subscriptions';
```

---

### Problem: Free Tier User Still Seeing "Upgrade" Gate

**Symptoms:**
- User cancelled subscription
- Database shows `plan_id = 'free'`
- But UI shows upgrade gate blocking content

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check SubscriptionGate logic
2. Check `hasSubscription` calculation in `getClientSubscription()`
3. Refresh browser cache

**Common Causes:**
- Frontend cache not refreshed
- `hasSubscription` logic incorrect for free tier

**Fix:**
```typescript
// In lib/subscription/client.ts
const hasActiveSubscription =
  subscription.plan_id !== 'free' &&
  ['active', 'trialing'].includes(subscription.status)

return {
  hasSubscription: hasActiveSubscription,  // Should be false for free
  planId: subscription.plan_id,            // Should be 'free'
  // ...
}
```

---

## 📝 Future Improvements
