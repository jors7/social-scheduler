## Full Script with Timing

### 00:00 - Opening
**Visual**: SocialCal logo/dashboard
**Script**: 
"Welcome! Today I'm showing you how SocialCal handles multi-post threads on Threads, even with Meta's API limitations."

### 00:10 - Problem Statement
**Visual**: Meta Developer Dashboard showing permissions
**Script**:
"Meta hasn't approved the threads_manage_replies permission for our app, which normally would prevent creating connected threads. But we've built a smart solution."

### 00:20 - Test Account Demo Setup
**Visual**: Navigate to Create New Post
**Script**:
"Let me show you how it works. I'm logged in with a test account that has special privileges."

### 00:30 - Creating a Thread
**Visual**: Type in the thread composer
**Script**:
"I'll create a 3-part thread about social media tips."

**Type**:
```
Post 1: "ðŸš€ 3 Quick Tips for Better Social Media Engagement"
Post 2: "ðŸ’¡ Tip 1: Post consistently at peak times when your audience is most active"
Post 3: "âœ¨ Tip 2: Use relevant hashtags but don't overdo it - quality over quantity!"
```

### 00:50 - Posting Process
**Visual**: Click "Post Now" button
**Script**:
"Watch what happens when I post this..."

### 00:55 - Success Message
**Visual**: Show success toast
**Script**:
"Notice the message - 'Thread posted as connected replies'. This means it created a real thread."

### 01:00 - Verify on Threads
**Visual**: Switch to Threads.net
**Script**:
"Let's check Threads... Perfect! You can see all three posts are connected with the reply indicator."

### 01:15 - Production Account Explanation
**Visual**: Return to SocialCal dashboard
**Script**:
"Now, for regular users without test privileges, the app automatically detects this and switches to a numbered format."

### 01:25 - Show Numbered Example
**Visual**: Show example or switch accounts
**Script**:
"Instead of connected replies, it would post:
- [1/3] First tip...
- [2/3] Second tip...
- [3/3] Third tip..."

### 01:40 - Technical Insight
**Visual**: Show code snippet or flowchart
**Script**:
"The magic happens automatically. Our system tries the connected thread first, and if it hits a permission error, it instantly falls back to numbered posts. Users don't need to do anything different."

### 01:55 - Benefits Summary
**Visual**: Bullet points on screen
**Script**:
"This means:
- Test accounts get full functionality
- Production users still get organized threads
- No manual configuration needed
- Future-ready when permissions are approved"

### 02:10 - Call to Action
**Visual**: SocialCal homepage/signup
**Script**:
"Try SocialCal today for seamless social media scheduling across all platforms. Link in the description!"

### 02:20 - End Screen
