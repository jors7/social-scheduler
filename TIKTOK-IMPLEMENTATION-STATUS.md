# TikTok Implementation Status & Known Issues

## Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Working

### What's Working ✅
- OAuth authentication and account connection
- API calls successfully reach TikTok
- Publish IDs are generated
- Proper error handling

### What's NOT Working ❌
- Videos don't appear in TikTok drafts
- Status check returns "invalid_publish_id"
- PULL_FROM_URL method seems unreliable

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
TikTok's PULL_FROM_URL method is failing because:
1. **URL Ownership**: Even with verified domain, TikTok may not be able to access the proxy
2. **Processing Failures**: Videos fail silently during TikTok's processing
3. **Invalid Publish IDs**: The IDs become invalid immediately, suggesting upload rejection

### Evidence
- Publish ID format: `v_inbox_url~v2.XXXXX` (inbox URL indicates draft/private)
- Status check fails with `invalid_publish_id`
- No videos appear in drafts even after 10+ minutes

## Why This Is Happening

### TikTok's Upload Methods
1. **PULL_FROM_URL** (Current - Not Working)
   - TikTok downloads video from your URL
   - Requires domain verification
   - Often fails silently
   - Less reliable

2. **FILE_UPLOAD** (Recommended - Not Implemented)
   - Direct upload to TikTok servers
   - More reliable
   - Requires chunked upload implementation
   - Complex but works consistently

## Recommended Solution

### Option 1: Switch to FILE_UPLOAD Method
**Pros:**
- More reliable
- Direct feedback on upload progress
- Works with unverified domains

**Cons:**
- Complex implementation (chunked uploads)
- Requires significant code changes

### Option 2: Use TikTok's Web Upload
**Pros:**
- Simple implementation
- Let users upload through TikTok's website
- 100% reliable

**Cons:**
- Not fully automated
- Requires user interaction

### Option 3: Wait for TikTok Advanced Access
**Pros:**
- May resolve current issues
- Official support from TikTok

**Cons:**
- Unknown timeline
- May not fix PULL_FROM_URL issues

## Temporary Workaround

Until we implement FILE_UPLOAD or get Advanced Access:

1. **Save video URLs in database**
   - Store the video URL when user posts
   - Provide a "Copy Video URL" button
   - User can manually upload to TikTok

2. **Clear messaging to users**
   - "TikTok integration is in beta"
   - "Videos need manual upload until full approval"
   - Provide step-by-step instructions

## Implementation TODO

If continuing with TikTok integration:

```javascript
// 1. Implement FILE_UPLOAD method
async function uploadVideoChunks(videoFile, accessToken) {
  // Initialize upload
  const { upload_url, chunk_size } = await initializeUpload();
  
  // Upload chunks
  for (let chunk of chunks) {
    await uploadChunk(upload_url, chunk);
  }
  
  // Finalize upload
  return await finalizeUpload();
}

// 2. Add retry logic
async function postToTikTokWithRetry(video, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await postToTikTok(video);
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
      await sleep(5000 * (i + 1)); // Exponential backoff
    }
  }
}
```

## Current Error Messages

### URL Ownership Error
```
url_ownership_unverified: Please review our URL ownership verification rules
```
**Fix Applied:** Added tiktok-app-ads.txt, using verified domain proxy

### Invalid Publish ID
```
invalid_params: invalid_publish_id
```
**Cause:** Video upload failed during processing, ID becomes invalid

### Unaudited Client Error
```
unaudited_client_can_only_post_to_private_accounts
```
**Status:** Awaiting TikTok Advanced Access approval

## Conclusion

TikTok integration is **technically complete** but **functionally limited** due to:
1. Unaudited app status (awaiting TikTok approval)
2. PULL_FROM_URL method unreliability
3. Need for FILE_UPLOAD implementation for production use

**Recommendation:** 
- Continue with Advanced Access application
- Consider implementing FILE_UPLOAD method if TikTok is critical
- Set clear expectations with users about current limitations
