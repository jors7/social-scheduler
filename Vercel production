Local Development:
  # Always run this when developing locally
  stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/api/webhooks/stripe

  Production (Vercel):
  1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
  2. Add endpoint: https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe
  3. Select events:
    - checkout.session.completed
    - customer.subscription.updated
    - customer.subscription.deleted
    - invoice.payment_succeeded
  4. Copy the signing secret (starts with whsec_)
  5. Add to Vercel environment variables as STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

  This way:
  - ✅ Local development works with Stripe CLI
  - ✅ Production works with the dashboard webhook
  - ✅ Both can run simultaneously without conflicts
  - ✅ No code changes needed when switching environments

  The webhook handler I just updated will try both secrets, so it's even more flexible
  now!
