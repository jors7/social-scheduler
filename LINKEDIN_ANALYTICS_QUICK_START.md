# LinkedIn Analytics - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 What Was Built

Complete LinkedIn analytics integration with:
- ✅ Real-time post metrics (impressions, reach, engagement)
- ✅ Historical data tracking
- ✅ Automated hourly refresh
- ✅ Beautiful dashboard UI
- ✅ Database storage with analytics
- ✅ Graceful handling of API approval pending

## 📋 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Apply for LinkedIn API Access (PRIORITY 🔴)

**Time Required**: 15 minutes
**Approval Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

**Steps**:
1. Go to https://developer.linkedin.com/ → "My Apps"
2. Select your LinkedIn app
3. Click "Products" tab
4. Find "Community Management API" → Click "Request access"
5. Fill out form with this use case:

```
SocialCal provides social media analytics to help users optimize their LinkedIn content strategy. We request Community Management API access to display post performance metrics (impressions, reach, engagement) for content published through our platform. Users need analytics to understand which posts resonate with their audience and improve their LinkedIn presence.
```

6. Submit application
7. Check status in Developer Portal

### 2. Run Database Migration

**Time Required**: 2 minutes

Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250124_linkedin_analytics.sql
-- This creates the linkedin_analytics and linkedin_api_quota tables
```

Or use Supabase CLI:
```bash
supabase db push
```

### 3. Configure Cron Job

**Time Required**: 5 minutes

Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron/refresh-linkedin-analytics",
    "schedule": "0 * * * *"
  }]
}
```

Add environment variable:
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
CRON_SECRET=your-secure-random-string-here
```

Generate secret:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 4. Deploy Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add LinkedIn analytics integration"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy.

## 🧪 Testing Before Approval

1. Navigate to Analytics dashboard
2. Check LinkedIn tab
3. You should see "API Approval Required" message
4. Click "Apply for API Access" button
5. Verify it opens LinkedIn Developer Portal

✅ **This is expected!** Analytics will work once API is approved.

## 📊 What Happens After Approval

1. **Reconnect LinkedIn Account** (to get new scopes)
   - Go to Settings
   - Disconnect LinkedIn
   - Reconnect LinkedIn
   - Approve new permissions

2. **Create Test Post**
   - Use SocialCal to publish to LinkedIn
   - Wait 1 hour for cron job (or trigger manually)

3. **View Analytics**
   - Analytics dashboard will show:
     - Impressions
     - Members Reached
     - Reactions
     - Comments
     - Reshares
     - Engagement Rate

## 📁 Files Reference

### Key Files Created
- `lib/linkedin/analytics-service.ts` - Analytics API service
- `app/api/linkedin/member-analytics/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `app/api/cron/refresh-linkedin-analytics/route.ts` - Hourly refresh
- `supabase/migrations/20250124_linkedin_analytics.sql` - Database schema
- `docs/LINKEDIN_API_SETUP.md` - Full setup guide (read this!)

### Files Modified
- `app/api/auth/linkedin/route.ts` - Added analytics scopes
- `components/dashboard/analytics/linkedin-insights.tsx` - New UI

## 🔧 Manual Testing Commands

### Validate API Access
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/linkedin/member-analytics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"accountId": "account-id-here"}'
```

### Trigger Manual Refresh
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/refresh-linkedin-analytics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Check Analytics Data
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM linkedin_analytics
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id'
ORDER BY fetched_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "API Approval Required" message shows
- **Status**: ✅ Expected before approval
- **Action**: Apply for API access (see Step 1 above)

**Issue**: No analytics data after approval
- **Check 1**: Did you reconnect LinkedIn account?
- **Check 2**: Is cron job running? (Check Vercel logs)
- **Check 3**: Do posts have LinkedIn URN saved? (Check database)

**Issue**: Cron job fails
- **Check**: `CRON_SECRET` environment variable set?
- **Check**: Cron configuration in `vercel.json`?
- **Logs**: Vercel → Deployments → Your deployment → Cron Logs

## 📈 Success Metrics

After going live, monitor:
- ✅ API quota usage (should be < 100 requests/day)
- ✅ Analytics dashboard load time (< 2 seconds)
- ✅ Cron job success rate (> 95%)
- ✅ User engagement with analytics feature

## 🎯 Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Implementation | Complete | ✅ Done |
| API Application | 15 minutes | ⏳ Your action |
| LinkedIn Review | 1-2 weeks | ⏳ Waiting |
| Standard Tier | +1-2 weeks | ⏳ After dev approval |
| **Total** | **2-4 weeks** | |
