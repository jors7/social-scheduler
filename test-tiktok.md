# TikTok Production Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

1. **Updated API Credentials** 
   - Client Key: `aw5ervnsbpztdk43` (your approved app)
   - Client Secret: `WBpgFpn2OR4SpzTv59pz9k1P4GGtwhCR`
   - Added `TIKTOK_SANDBOX=false` to enable production mode

2. **Fixed Service Implementation**
   - Sandbox mode now controlled by environment variable
   - Character limit updated from 150 to 2200
   - Success response returns properly in production mode

3. **Server Running**
   - Development server is running on http://localhost:3001
   - All environment variables loaded

## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Connect TikTok Account
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard/settings
2. Click "Connect" next to TikTok
3. Complete the OAuth flow with your TikTok account
4. Verify account shows as connected

### 2. Test Video Posting
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard/create/new
2. Select TikTok as the platform
3. Add your caption (up to 2200 characters now!)
4. Upload a video file (MP4 recommended)
5. Set privacy level:
   - `PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE` for public posts
   - `MUTUAL_FOLLOW_FRIENDS` for friends only
   - `SELF_ONLY` for drafts
6. Click "Post Now"

### 3. Check Results
- If successful, you'll get a publish ID
- The video will be processed by TikTok (takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes)
- Check your TikTok profile to see the posted video

### 4. Verify Scheduled Posting
1. Create a new post with TikTok selected
2. Click "Schedule" instead of "Post Now"
3. Set a future date/time
4. The post will be published at the scheduled time

## üìä What to Expect

### Success Response (Production):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "sandbox": false,
  "publishId": "v2.publish.abc123",
  "message": "TikTok video upload initiated successfully. Processing may take 30 seconds to 2 minutes."
}
```

### If Still in Sandbox:
- Check that Vercel has the updated environment variables
- The response will show `"sandbox": true` if still in sandbox mode

## üîç Debugging

### Check Status Endpoint
You can check the status of a video upload using the publish ID:
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard/tiktok-debug
2. Enter the publish ID from your post
3. Check the upload status

### Common Issues:
- **"scope_not_authorized"**: Need to reconnect account with proper scopes
- **Video requirements**: TikTok has specific video requirements (format, size, duration)
- **Processing time**: Videos take 30 seconds to 2 minutes to appear on TikTok

## üìà Analytics (Future - Phase 2)

Analytics features require additional scopes:
- `user.info.profile` - Extended profile info
- `user.info.stats` - Follower/engagement metrics  
- `video.list` - Access to posted videos

These will need separate app review approval from TikTok.
