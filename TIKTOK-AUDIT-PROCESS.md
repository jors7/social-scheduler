# TikTok Content Audit Process

## Current Status
✅ **App Approved**: You have production credentials
❌ **Content Audit**: Required for public posting

## What This Means
- Your app can post videos to TikTok
- Videos will be saved as **drafts** in the TikTok app
- Users must manually publish from within TikTok

## How to Get Full Public Posting Access

### Step 1: Prepare for Audit
1. Have at least 5 test videos ready
2. Document your use cases
3. Prepare screenshots of your app

### Step 2: Submit for Content Audit
1. Log in to [TikTok Developer Portal](https://developers.tiktok.com)
2. Go to your app: `aw5ervnsbpztdk43`
3. Navigate to "App Review" or "Content Audit"
4. Submit the following:
   - **Use Case**: "Social media management platform for content creators"
   - **Sample Videos**: Upload 5 test videos
   - **App Screenshots**: Show your posting interface
   - **Content Guidelines Compliance**: Confirm you follow TikTok's guidelines

### Step 3: Requirements to Pass Audit
- ✅ Clear content moderation policies
- ✅ User consent for posting
- ✅ Appropriate content warnings
- ✅ No automated spam posting
- ✅ Respect rate limits

### Step 4: Wait for Review
- Usually takes 2-5 business days
- You'll receive an email with the result
- If rejected, address feedback and resubmit

## Temporary Solution (Until Audit Approval)

### For Your Users:
1. Posts will save to TikTok drafts
2. Open TikTok app
3. Go to Profile → Drafts
4. Select the video and tap "Post"

### Update Your UI:
Show this message when posting to TikTok:
```
"Your video has been saved to TikTok drafts. Open the TikTok app to publish it. (Full automation coming soon!)"
```

## After Audit Approval

Once approved, update your environment:
```
TIKTOK_UNAUDITED=false
```

Then your app can post directly to public!

## Common Audit Rejection Reasons
- Insufficient content moderation
- Missing user consent flows
- Automated posting without user interaction
- Violating TikTok community guidelines
- Poor video quality standards

## Current Workaround
Your app is configured to automatically post to drafts. This is working correctly and provides value to users while you await full audit approval.
